Matching a Hex Value

This this tutorial you should be able to understand how to understand a regdex or regular expression. What this all boils down to is how a specific search pattern is defined. When you include it in your code it should be able to help you certain items in string values. They are also used to input data. 

## Summary
I choose to do a html tag, the snippet of the regex is as follows, /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/  
In the following secitions I will break down the values of the regex.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
^ and $
These two character basically start and end the string. Whatever is inbetween them is what will be used to match the search.
